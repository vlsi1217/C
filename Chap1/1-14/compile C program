it is much easier and faster to compile C program in Ubuntu than in Win7.

Only 3 steps:
1. Create a .c file in a foler. i.e.: Here I use /home/KR-C
2. get into the destination in "terminal" and compile it by typing:
	gcc filename.c -o filename
3. run the compiled executable file by typing: ./filename
