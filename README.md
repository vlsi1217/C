After so long a while I finally setup my github accout and create several files and folders on the remote Repo.
Here are some notes: 
1. I can simply create folders and files in windows. But, if you want to syn your files. You must commit them 
	on the Github windows before synchronize them.
2. How to delete files or folders in remote Repo?

I am now starting to finish Chap 1 and start Chap 2. Today is Sept 25, 2012.
